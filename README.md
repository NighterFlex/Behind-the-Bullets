# Behind the Bullets - FPS GAME DATABASE
Behind the Bullets is a database project focused on organizing key data for a multiplayer FPS game, inspired by Valorant, all built using MySQL

A database project I did with my duo for my Database Systems course, inspired by Valorant. This ones all about storing, managing, and retrieving multiplayer game data from players and agents to weapons, skins, and ranks. All built in MySQL.

# 📌 Project Overview
Think Valorant, but from the backend.

This database keeps track of:

👤 Player accounts (username, email, login history, hashed passwords—yep, we hashed 'em)

🕵️‍♀️ Agents (abilities, roles, ultimates)

🗺️ Matches (who played, what map, kills, deaths, results, and the full KDA shebang)

🔫 Weapons & Skins (types, rarity, and which player owns what)

🧬 Ranking system (MMR, level system, leaderboard position)

💸 In-game purchases (what players bought and when)
